# Makasalanan

I'm trying to not follow the deadly sins which are:

- the use of hidden fields
- use of raw queries (i used an orm)
- not validating (i validated client and server-side)

**Install packages**

Install packages used in this app by running

```
npm install
```

**Database**

<code>npx sequelize db:create</code> to create the tables

<code>npx sequelize db:migrate</code> to generate the tables

## Running the app

```
node app
```
